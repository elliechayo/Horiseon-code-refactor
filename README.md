# Horiseon-code-refactor



 

 ## Description 


The objective of the project was to clean up and enhance the existing code of the Horiseon webpage. We were asked to do so by adhering to accessibility standards and by improving its search engine optimization.  The existing code was modified in a manner that achieved the objectives without changing its functionality or its external display.




**WorkCompleted**

The following was completed within the index.html code:

* Replaced non-semantic HTML elements with the semantic ones. 
* Restructured the order of the HTML elements to follow a logical order independent of styling and positioning
* Added accessible alt attributes to images 
* Omitted unused classes 
* Condensed repeated code 
* Added a concise and descriptive title 
* Delineated sections or elements by adding comments

The following tasks were completed within the CSS code:

* Consolidated CSS selectors and properties
* Reorganized CSS code elements to follow the semantic structure of the index.html code
* Delineated sections or elements by adding comments
